# Naive-Bayes
Simple Naives Bayes Machine Learning on Diabetes and Car datasets. (Python2 because this code is really old)

Cars:  
Predict where a car was built based on its attributes (look at Bayes Report.pdf for more information)  
Dataset from: https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall00/G22.3033-001/weka/weka-3-0-2/data/auto-mpg.arff

Diabetes:  
I really don't remember  
Datasets from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
